# TODO List - Image Sequence Converter Project

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

### Project Setup & Documentation
- [x] **Compare current local state with GitHub repository**
  - Local repo is on `dev` branch, up to date with `origin/dev`
  - Identified changes: modified files and untracked `_EXE/` directory

- [x] **Add _EXE directory to .gitignore**
  - Added `_EXE/` to prevent executable builds from being committed

- [x] **Assess current project state and identify potential bugs**
  - **Critical Bug**: File sequence parsing breaks if file names contain spaces (file_sequence.py:114)
  - **Medium Bug**: Limited error handling for FFmpeg failures
  - **Minor Bug**: Progress dialog updates may not be accurate

- [x] **Create SYSTEM_RULES.md with git push approval rule**
  - Added rule: NEVER push to GitHub unless explicitly approved by the user
  - Included development environment guidelines
  - Added project-specific rules for VFX workflows

- [x] **Create comprehensive README.md for GitHub**
  - Professional documentation with features, installation, and usage instructions
  - Detailed technical information about the application
  - Known issues section with identified bugs
  - Contributing guidelines and project structure

- [x] **Prepare first commit with clear message about project pickup**
  - All changes staged and ready
  - Commit message prepared
  - Waiting for user approval per SYSTEM_RULES.md

## üéØ Current Status

### Ready for Commit
- **Files Staged**: `.gitignore`, `README.md`, `SYSTEM_RULES.md`, `file_sequence.py`, `main_window.py`
- **Commit Message**: "Project revival: First commit since picking up development again"
- **Status**: ‚è≥ **Waiting for user approval to push to GitHub**

## üêõ Known Issues (To Fix Later)

### Critical Issues
- [ ] **Missing Last Frame Bug** - Frame range calculation loses the last frame
  - Location: `src/main/python/package/worker.py:24`
  - Formula: `framerange = end - start - (head + tail)` ‚ùå MISSING +1
  - Should be: `framerange = end - start + 1 - (head + tail)` ‚úÖ
  - Impact: Always loses the last frame of every sequence
  - Priority: **CRITICAL**

- [ ] **File Name Parsing Bug** - Sequence parsing breaks with spaces in file names
  - Location: `src/main/python/package/file_sequence.py:114`
  - Impact: Will cause index errors for sequences with spaces
  - Priority: High

### Medium Issues
- [ ] **Error Handling** - Limited error handling for FFmpeg failures
  - Need comprehensive error handling for subprocess calls
  - Should provide user-friendly error messages
  - Priority: Medium

### Minor Issues
- [ ] **Progress Updates** - Progress dialog may not update properly
  - Location: `src/main/python/package/main_window.py:347`
  - Impact: User experience during long conversions
  - Priority: Low

## üîÑ Next Steps

### Immediate (After User Approval)
1. Execute commit with prepared message
2. Push changes to GitHub repository
3. Verify all changes are properly uploaded

### Future Development
1. Fix file name parsing bug for spaces
2. Implement comprehensive error handling
3. Improve progress tracking accuracy
4. Add more output formats
5. Implement preset saving/loading
6. Add command-line interface

## üìù Development Notes

### Recent Changes
- Increased trim head/tail range from 100 to 2000 frames
- Cleaned up commented code in main_window.py
- Added bug documentation comments
- Created professional documentation

### Project Structure
- Well-organized modular design
- Separate classes for conversion, file handling, preferences
- Worker thread for non-blocking UI
- Professional VFX workflow focus
