# System Rules

## Git Operations
- **NEVER push to GitHub unless explicitly approved by the user**
- Always ask for permission before any git operations (commit, push, etc.)
- Confirm with user before making any changes to the remote repository

## Development Environment
- Use Git Bash on Windows for terminal operations
- Create and use a virtual environment called `.venv` in the project root
- Install all dependencies in the virtual environment, not system-wide

## Code Quality
- Always check terminal command output carefully
- Verify that commands execute properly by checking actual terminal output
- Avoid paste mode artifacts in terminal commands

- Maintain compatibility with industry-standard formats (ProRes, ACEScg, etc.)
- Ensure proper color space management and LUT handling
- Keep the application focused on batch processing workflows
